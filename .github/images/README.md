## Screenshot Placeholder

Add your ThreadUp platform screenshot here:

- **Filename**: `screenshot-placeholder.png`
- **Recommended size**: 1800x1200px (or similar 3:2 ratio)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Content**: Main feed or landing page showing the platform's interface

### Tips for a great screenshot:

- Use a clean, populated feed with sample posts
- Show both light and dark theme if possible
- Include the header with navigation
- Capture the responsive design
- Ensure text is readable
- Use high-quality resolution

The screenshot will automatically have rounded corners and shadow styling applied via the README.
